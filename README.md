### Hello 👋

- 🎓 I'm wrapping up my PhD in Bioinformatics at UCSC in the [Brooks Lab](https://brookslab.soe.ucsc.edu)
- 🧬 I developed `eVIP2`, which is a tool for characterizing mutation impact using RNA-seq data
  - [eVIP2 publication in PLOS Comp Bio](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009132#sec028)
  - [eVIP2 repo](https://github.com/BrooksLabUCSC/eVIP2)
- ✨ I’m currently working on `sigil`, which is a tool that creates gene expression and splicing signatures in parallel 
- Previously, I interned at GRAIL, was an NIH PREP scholar, and studied biology at UF 🐊
